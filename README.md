# ZBOR

ZBOR is meant as a platform to promote the beauty of the Macedonian language and help research it better. The platform is planned to host various statistical data and analysis of multiple corpora. Furthermore, it is planned to host small interactive exhibits, where people can play with words, old and new.

### Fun facts about ZBOR

ZBOR is not a new idea. In fact, the author Mitko Nikov had the idea for open-source dictionary of the Macedonian language since he was in high school (around 2019). He developed the first version of ZBOR back then as a part of the project SchoolNet. Due to the fact that ZBOR was build on top of SchoolNet, it was hard to untangle it and host it separately. It is easier to build the platform from scratch with modern framework like Svelte and provide the users with better experience and more data.
